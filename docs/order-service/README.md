# Order Service
The Order Service demonstates the following concepts:
- Serverless Microservice
- [DynamoDB Event Emitter](../dynamo-event-emmiter/README.md)

// TODO Description of "Serverless Microservice"
// TODO Is there a good way to incorperate documentation generated from the OpenAPI spec?  Maybe just host a link to a (non-functional) Swagger page?
